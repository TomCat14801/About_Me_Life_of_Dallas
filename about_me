    <img src="img_9023.jpg" class="rounded">
    <p>I am a die hard Utah Utes fan. I have had season tickets to the Utah Utes football program for four years
        and havent missed a home game since. I also travel to away games as often as I can. My basement has been 
        converted into a mancave filled with Utah Utes memorabilia.
        I enjoy going to the tailgaiting parties before the games and meeting new people who are also Ute fans.
        I hope when I die, that my family can get the Utes to lower me down so they can let me down one last time.</p>

<h2 class="text-primary text-center">3D Printing</h2>
    <p>I enjoy 3-D printing. I baught my first 3-D printer five years ago to just mess around with. I started off with
        small projects and have worked my way up to trying to build a full size Iron Man suit. I make alot of things for
        people that have requested certain things. I need to start a small side business for selling my prints that I make
        for myself or other people. I've never charged anyone becuase i feel like it gives me practice on things that I 
        haven't made before.
